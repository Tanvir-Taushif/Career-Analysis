Welcome to my exploratory analysis of the **data analyst job market**, where I dive into the skills, salaries, and trends shaping the field today. This project aims to provide practical insights to help job seekers and professionals identify high-paying, high-demand opportunities in data analytics.

## 🔍 Project Purpose

This analysis was inspired by my curiosity to better understand the evolving job landscape for data analysts. By leveraging real-world data and Python tools, I’ve answered key questions that matter most to anyone navigating this career path, such as:

- Which skills are most in demand for the top 3 data-related roles?
- How are the most requested skills trending over time?
- What is the relationship between skill demand and salary?
- Which skills are both **high-paying** and **frequently requested**?

## 📁 Data Source

The dataset for this project was sourced from **Luke Barousse’s Python course**, which provides a rich collection of job postings, including job titles, locations, salaries, and required skills. This data served as a robust foundation for all of the visual and analytical insights in this project.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

To conduct this analysis, I utilized the following tools and technologies:

- **Python** — the core programming language for data processing and visualization.
- **Pandas** — used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.
- **Matplotlib** — for basic charting and visualizations.
- **Seaborn** — to build more sophisticated and visually appealing plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook** — to combine live code with visual output and markdown commentary.
- **Visual Studio Code** — my preferred IDE for running and testing Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub** — for version control, collaboration, and showcasing the final project.
